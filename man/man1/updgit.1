.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]updgit\f[R] - Perform git add/commit/push to the repo associated
with this clone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]updgit\f[R] [ \f[B]-u\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-a\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-d\f[R] ] [
\f[B]-m \[dq]message comment\[dq]\f[R] ] [ file1 ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Convenience script to combine the \f[I]git add\f[R], \f[I]git
commit\f[R], and \f[I]git push\f[R] operations into a single command.
In addition, \f[I]updgit\f[R] attempts to determine what the name of the
branch to push is.
This alleviates some of the irritation involved with the recent renaming
of the Github and Gitlab default branch from \[aq]master\[aq] to
\[aq]main\[aq].
