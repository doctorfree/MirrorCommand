slides - Play slideshows
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]slides\f[R] [ \f[B]-u\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-a\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-l\f[R] ] [
\f[B]-x\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-pP\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-S\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-n\f[R] numpics
] [ \f[B]-s\f[R] subdir ] directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]slides\f[R] displays a slideshow of prepared image folders.
.PP
The \f[I]slides\f[R] command tries to be smart about detecting which
platform it is running on and what slideshow facilities are available.
For example, if it detects that it is running on Apple Mac OS X and the
\f[I]osascript\f[R] facility is present then it opens the Preview App
and uses AppleScript to automatically control the Preview App, playing a
slideshow of the specified image folder.
.PP
On Linux systems \f[I]slides\f[R] tries to use
\f[I]variety-slideshow\f[R] to display the slideshow and, if
\f[I]variety-slideshow\f[R] is not present then \f[I]slides\f[R] uses
the \f[I]pcmanslideshow\f[R] command included in the
\f[B]DoctorFreeScripts package\f[R].
.PP
The \f[I]slides\f[R] command is a link to the \f[I]backgrounds\f[R]
command.
