\f[B]mirrorkeys\f[R] - configuration file for MirrorCommand keys
.SH INTRODUCTION
.PP
MagicMirror modules often utilize services that require registration and
generation of private keys to enable access to the service.
These keys are used in MagicMirror configuration files in the
modules\[aq] settings to allow MagicMirror to securely access these
services over the Internet.
The creation and maintenance of these multiple configuration settings
can be tedious and unreliable as these keys can be scattered over many
files and locations within files.
The \f[I]mirrorkeys\f[R] configuration file gathers all keys used by
MagicMirror and MirrorCommand into a single location along with an
extensible format to allow for the addition of new keys and removal of
old.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]/usr/local/MirrorCommand/etc/mirrorkeys\f[R] configuration file
contains two associative arrays, \f[I]keys\f[R] and \f[I]dumb\f[R].
Each service has an arbitrary unique identifying string that serves as
an array key.
For example, the array entries for the MagicMirror IP address use the
string identifier \f[I]MMIP\f[R] as the array key.
Each service has an entry in the \f[I]keys\f[R] array and a
corresponding entry in the \f[I]dumb\f[R] array.
The \f[I]dumb\f[R] array holds key/pair values that denote the
\[aq]dummy\[aq] value of that key.
These values serve as templates in the MagicMirror configuration files.
For example, the \f[I]dumb\f[R] array entry for the MagicMirror IP
address using the string identifier \f[I]MMIP\f[R] is the string
\f[I]MM.M.M.MM\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dumb[MMIP]=\[aq]MM.M.M.MM\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[I]keys\f[R] array holds the private key values and other settings
used in the MagicMirror and MirrorCommand configuration files.
For example, if the IP address of the MagicMirror system were
\f[I]10.0.1.85\f[R] then the \f[I]keys\f[R] array entry for the
MagicMirror IP address using the string identifier \f[I]MMIP\f[R] would
be the string \f[I]10.0.1.85\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
keys[MMIP]=\[aq]10.0.1.85\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The MirrorCommand package initializes a \f[I]mirrorkeys\f[R]
configuration file with over 40 preconfigured \[aq]dummy\[aq] values and
several \[aq]keys\[aq] values detected during installation.
It is the job of the MagicMirror system administrator to update the
\f[I]mirrorkeys\f[R] file with values for service keys used by activated
MagicMirror modules.
For example, if the MagicMirror is configured with the default
\f[I]weather\f[R] module then an OpenWeather application ID will be
required to utilize the OpenWeather service.
After acquiring an OpenWeather application ID from
<https://openweathermap.org> add it to the \f[I]mirrorkeys\f[R]
configuration file in the \f[I]keys\f[R] array for the \f[I]LOC\f[R]
service identifier:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
keys[LOC]=\[dq]somestringofcharactersthatisyourappid\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
After adding all the keys and configuration values used by MagicMirror
and MirrorCommand to the \f[I]mirrorkeys\f[R] file, execute the
\f[I]showkeys\f[R] command.
The \f[I]showkeys\f[R] command reads the \f[I]mirrorkeys\f[R]
configuration file and, for every key value that is set in the
\f[I]keys\f[R] array, edits the MagicMirror configuration files
replacing the dummy values specified in the \f[I]dumb\f[R] array with
the corresponding \f[I]keys\f[R] array entry.
If the \f[I]keys\f[R] array entry for a service is empty then no change
is made for that key.
